So far, I have created a 3:47 minute long soundscape narrative composed of 6 simultaneous tracks. The soundscapes tells the story of a sailor battling an intense storm at sea on his ship, until all of a sudden, 
the ship capsizes and the sailor falls into the sea, quickly becoming unconscious. The sailor then wakes up on a beach, surrounded by some seagulls. The sailor starts walking around to get a feel of his surroundings 
and catches the sound of a lullaby in the distance. Entranced, the sailor starts walking torwards the source of lullaby, gradually getting closer as the lullaby gets louder. The sailor encounters some sort of cave 
with a stone slab door, so they decide to open it given that the lullaby seems to originate from inside. Once opened, the sailor lights up a torch, starts walking past some bats and starts hearing some sort of crystal.
As he keeps walking deeper into the cave, the sound of the crystal as well as the lullaby get louder and louder until the lullaby stops, the sailor's torch goes out and the sound of the crystal begins to fade.

This story is meant to be open-ended for the listener to speculate as to what may have happened to the sailor once they reached the source of the lullaby; is it a siren luring a naive sailor as prey? perhaps it's a 
magical crystal that teleported the sailor somewhere else, or maybe the stone is radioactive and the sailor unknowingly succumbed to radiation poisoning inside the cave.

The effects used so far are:
- Reverb: Had to use reverb for the sounds inside the cave to denote the fact that the scenery is supposed to be an enclosed place.
- Echo: To make the lullaby seem distant.
- Amplify: To increase/decrease the volume of some sound effects.
- Reverse: I reversed the sound of the torch being lit up to simulate it being put out.
- Low-Pass filter: To remove unwanted high-pitched noises.
- Fade In: To simulate sounds getting closer.
- Fade Out: To simulate sounds getting further away.
